This helps expose boundary conditions and underlying assumptions early in the development process.

We should start by giving the scenario an intention revealing name, and then follow through by ensuring that every line in the scenario describes <code>intent</code>, not <code>mechanics</code>.</p><h4 id="common-anti-pattern-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#common-anti-pattern-2"><span>Common Anti-pattern</span></a></h4><p>Using UI terminology (e.g. click button, follow link).</p><h2 id="essential" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#essential"><span>Essential</span></a></h2><p>The purpose of a scenario is to illustrate how a rule should behave. Any parts of a scenario that don&#39;t directly contribute to this purpose are incidental and should be removed. If they are important to the system, then they will be covered in other scenarios that illustrate other rules. Additionally, any scenarios that do not add to the reader&#39;s understanding of the expected behaviour have no place in the documentation.</p><h4 id="common-anti-pattern-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#common-anti-pattern-3"><span>Common Anti-pattern</span></a></h4><p>Including too much incidental detail (e.g. a rule that depends on the date should not be illustrated using date &amp; time, unless the rule&#39;s behaviour may be affected by the time)</p><h2 id="focused" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#focused"><span>Focused</span></a></h2><p>Most scenarios should be focused on illustrating a <code>single rule</code>.
